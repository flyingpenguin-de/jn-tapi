2000 compliance</strong></a></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">We recognize that there is much uncertainty within the
technology industry regarding the &quot;year 2000&quot; issue. JulMar Technology would
like to resolve any uncertainty you may have regarding our TSP++ products. </p>

<p>The TSP++ products do not use software time or date code and will therefore should be
unaffected by the date change to the year 2000. All time-related functionality is
performed using milliseconds that are taken directly from the Windows operating system. No
conversion to any other form is done with these values and they are stored internally as
32-bit <b> DWORD</b> numbers. They are used only for elapsed time calculations with no reliance
upon day, month, or year.</p>

<p>The TSP++ libraries do rely upon specific operating system services that use
millisecond timeout values. Since these timeout values are not date-dependant and no
conversion occurs within the operating system, the chance for failure of these functions
due to Y2K issues should be fairly low. It is recommended that any shipped service
provider be run on the latest service packs from Microsoft in order to alleviate any known
Windows Y2K issues.</p>

<p>This warranty statement only applies to the basic TSP++ library and sample code
provided, not necessarily to any TAPI service provider developed with that product.</font></p>

<p>Thank you for using our products,</p>
