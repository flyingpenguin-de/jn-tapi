					and Miscellaneous Notes</strong></font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JulMar has tested TSP++ extensively on an 
				multi-processor server (<b>SMP</b>) running at an average load of 20-30 calls 
				per second. The calls are averaged across outgoing external, incoming external 
				(routed), and station to station calls. We focus specifically on a small group 
				of lines in order to test object locking and contention. </font>
		</p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> As part of that testing, we have uncovered problems 
				with the underlying libraries that are used inside TSP++ when compiling with 
				Visual C++ 6.0.&nbsp; If you intend to use Visual Studio 6.0,&nbsp;we recommend 
				that you update the Visual C++ <b>STL</b> header files with fixes from <a href="http://www.dinkumware.com">
					<font color="#000000">Dinkumware</font></a>. (<STRONG>Note that this 
					configuration is not supported</STRONG>) Make sure to especially update the <b>xtree</b>
				header which is used as the basis for the <b><u>map/multimap/set/multiset</u></b>
				templates. The shipped version with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 (including SP5) 
				has several thread safety problems and causes deadlocks under stress conditions 
				within the C-runtime library. The patches can be obtained for free at </font>

				Visual Studio .NET 2002/2003&nbsp;(VC7) does not suffer from these issues and 
				includes most of the patches already.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We have tried to find and correct all instances of 
				deadlocks within the library code, but since deadlocks are extremely sensitive 
				to API ordering and event handling, different provider implementations can 
				expose problems that we don't see or have in our test cases. If you have a 
				deadlock or multi-threading issue, please send us an e-mail with the system 
				configuration, log (if available), stack snapshots (from Visual Studio or Dr. 
				Watson), a .MAP file from your tested build that exhibits the problem, and the 
				basic test case (i.e. what was happening) which caused the problem. We will try 
				to fix any reported problem within a few days. Please send the reports to </font>
